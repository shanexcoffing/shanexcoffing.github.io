<h3> (A)synchrony: the oscillator as fallible memory </h3>
<h4> <em> Mixed media, steel, motors, light bulbs. 2021. Submission for Currents 2022 </em> </h4>

There are several distinct forms of Synchronicity:
- the memory machine: each oscillator tells a story of fractured memories
- object assembly: each oscillator is tethered to an object, each object tells a story, when the objects come near a center, their oscillator begins to tell that story
- simplicity: without a recording, the display can be formulated to provide mesmerizing visual. when synchronicity is achieved they all may light up or something spectacular may occur

<h2> Physics and art as approximation.  </h2>

<p>
I am physics PhD student in my final year and I study shock dynamics and radiation (light) transport through two media: foam in laser experiments and the edges of hot stars as supernovae explode through them. These extreme phenomenon occur on vastly different scales of time, length, and energy, but surpsingly have little disconnect. Physics says if the same processeses (the movement of light through media) are occuring in one, they must, in the same consistent way occur in the other; and elucidating these phenomenon through is the primary goal of my scientific journey.
</p>

<p>
What this means is that every day I program in languages like C, Fortran, and Python, writing algorithms to explore fundamental physics; display scientific data convincingly and beautifully through plots and charts; and develop creative scientific models; all to try to explore what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_transfer">the equation of radiative transfer</a>, $$ {\frac {1}{c}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}I_{\nu }+{\hat {\Omega }}\cdot \nabla I_{\nu }+(k_{\nu ,s}+k_{\nu ,a})I_{\nu }=j_{\nu }+{\frac {1}{4\pi }}k_{\nu ,s}\int _{\Omega }I_{\nu }d\Omega,  $$

really means for our physical wold. Written simply, the above equation  says that, if we look at a source of light:

$$ (\textrm{how light behaves in space and time}) =(\textrm{how the source gives light}) $$ $$ - (\textrm{how the medium absorbs, emits, and scatters light})
$$
</p>

<p>
As a student of art, my goal is only slightly different: to not only try to understand how light moves through but understand what physics simply cannot, how light moves us. My study begins with the ansatz that <strong> our physical understanding of the natural world is only an approximation </strong> and that <strong> art approximates life. </strong> My tools in art are not so different from science -- I still write code, display scientific data, and develop models to research art as approximation to the world. But my art has a distinct form and this document serves to help elucidate its physical manifestations.
