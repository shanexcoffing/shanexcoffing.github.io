<h3> Synchrony </h3>
<h4> <em> Mixed media, steel, motors, light bulbs. 2021. Submission for Currents New Media 2022 </em> </h4>

<p>
In Synchrony, each rotator represents a thought, feeling, or memory that seems extant but distant, uncorrelated, taking no clear temporal shape but having notable regularity, piecewise and fractured. Synchrony is the desire for the seemingly unnatural concurrence of these thoughts, for a fleeting and beautiful moment of clarity when everything comes together, arising impossibly from a state of endless, dynamic, mechanistic, asynchrony.

<p>
This video shows a single quadrant of the full piece. The entire piece consists of 4 quadrants, providing a 6 by 6 grid of evenly spaced rotators. Syncrhony is fully constructed but I will upload a video in the upcoming week when I am able to transport the piece to a full wall.

<h2> Artist Bio </h2>
<p>
I am a physics PhD student and an artist. My practice begins with the premise that our physical understanding of the natural world is never more than an approximation and that art does not imitate, but approximates life. As a scientist, I study the light that stars emit when they explode in their supernova deaths. I write algorithms to explore astrophysical concepts; develop creative scientific models; and display scientific data convincingly and beautifully through plots and charts, all in attempt to simplify our complex world. As an artist, my tools are not so different -- I still write algorithms, display scientific data, and develop models for interpretation. But while my scientific research dwells in the theoretical, it is my art that generates its physical manifestation.
